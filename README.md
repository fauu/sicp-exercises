sicp-exercises
==============

My personal collection of solved excercises from the book _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. I'm doing selected exercises from the book as I go through it so they are surely not perfect but will hopefully improve over time.

Full text of the book (including instructions for the exercises) is available free of charge [here](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

Written in Scheme. All files are ready to be executed in the shell, given that [GNU Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile) is present on the system.
